My name is Brad. I build web sites and make photos in Atlanta.
I'm available for hire! Take a look at my resume and send me an email if you'd like to get in touch.

## I code things
I have been building websites and other web stuff since 1999, working with teams and clients in academia,  start-ups,  corporate,  and non-profit work environments.

## I make photo
Over the last couple years, I have been focused on [photography](/photos) and taking a break from the web. Most of the images I post are landscapes from parks in Atlanta, but I’m also a sucker for wandering downtown’s [sky bridges](TKTKTK) and the  [cavernous hotel lobbys](TKTKTK).   It was pretty great to have the opportunity to learn more about photograph, but I ’d like to keep it as a hobby.

## I make art
 I like to think  of myself as a creative person. i play some instruments,  while i’m master at none of them,  I like to pretend for a s long as people will let me.
I try spend some time drawing everyday and over the past year have been learning how to paint.
