## I code things
I have been building websites, applications, and other web stuff since 1999, including front-end development, back-end development, database design, social media integration, and HTML email, while working in academia, start-ups, corporate, and non-profit work environments.

## I make photographs
Over the last couple of years, I took a break from web work to pursue a focus on [photography](/photos).
Most of the images I post are <a href="https://www.huchteman.com/Projects-/Nature-Landscapes/i-xgcvrpw/2/9599a916/X3/20180222-DSC02927-Edit-X3.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Mind The Gap" class="ig-thumb-link">landscapes</a> from Atlanta's parks, but I also love the  <a href="https://www.huchteman.com/Projects-/Atlanta/i-RR2j6Pn/0/4493313f/X3/20180831-DSC00892-Edit-X3.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Avoids Transitions" class="sm-item-link">sky bridges</a> and <a href="https://www.huchteman.com/Projects-/Atlanta/i-szXbf56/0/e1d3dc17/X3/20170902-DSC02251-Edit-X3.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Core Temp and Symmetry" class="ig-thumb-link">hotel architecture</a> downtown. I currently shoot with an old Sony a6000, but thinking about Olympus for my next.
I contribute  photos to google maps as google local guide.
My photos on Google Maps have over [6M views](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116237027913673287579/photos/@34.2146746,-84.4298275,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e2).
I am selling prints at [huchteman.com](https://huchteman.com) and stock photography at [shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/g/Brad+Huchteman).


## I make art
I think of myself as a creative type. I love playing music. I usually play the guitar or drums, but I'll attempt to play along with any instrument available. Especially if there is someone else around to play music with. I try to make a habit of drawing every day.
I mostly use a black pen with a tiny tip, but recently, I have been experimenting with brush pens and markers. Over the past year, I have been learning how to paint.
