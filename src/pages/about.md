## I code things
I have been building websites and other web stuff since 1999, working with teams and clients in academia, start-ups, corporate, and non-profit work environments.

## I make photographs
Over the last couple years, I have been focused on [photography](/photos) and taking a break from the web.
Most of the images I post are <a href="https://www.huchteman.com/Projects-/Nature-Landscapes/i-xgcvrpw/2/9599a916/X3/20180222-DSC02927-Edit-X3.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Mind The Gap" class="ig-thumb-link">landscapes</a> from Atlanta's parks, but I also love to wander downtown’s [sky bridges](TKTKTK) and <a href="https://www.huchteman.com/Projects-/Atlanta/i-szXbf56/0/e1d3dc17/X3/20170902-DSC02251-Edit-X3.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Core Temp and Symmetry" class="ig-thumb-link">hotel architecture</a>. It was pretty great to have the opportunity to learn more about photograph, but I ’d like to keep it as a hobby.


## I make art
I like to think  of myself as a creative person. I play some instruments, while I’m master at none of them, I like to pretend for as long as people will let me.
I try spend some time drawing everyday and over the past year have been learning how to paint.
