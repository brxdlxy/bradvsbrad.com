## I code things

I have been building websites, applications, and other web stuff since 1999, including front-end development, back-end development, database design, social media integration, and HTML email while working in a range of academia, start-ups, corporate, and non-profit work environments.

## I make photographs

Over the last couple of years, I took a break from web work to pursue a focus on [photography](/photos).
Most of the images I post are <a href="https://bradvsbrad.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/ar/md/20180222-DSC02927-Edit_MD.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Mind The Gap" class="sm-item-link">landscapes</a> from Atlanta's parks, but I also love the <a href="https://bradvsbrad.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/ar/md/20180831-DSC00892-Edit_MD.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Avoids Transitions" class="sm-item-link">sky bridges</a> and
<a href="https://bradvsbrad.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/ar/md/20170902-DSC02251-Edit_MD.jpg" data-lightbox="sm-recent" data-title="Core Temp and Symmetry" class="sm-item-link">hotel architecture</a> downtown. I currently shoot with an old Sony a6000 but thinking about Olympus for my next.
I contribute photos to google maps as a google local guide.
My photos on Google Maps have over [6M views](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116237027913673287579/photos/@34.2146746,-84.4298275,9z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m3!8m2!3m1!1e2). Prints are available upon request.

## I make art

I think of myself as a creative. I love playing music. I usually play the guitar or drums, but I'll attempt to play along with any instrument available — especially if there's someone else around to play with. I try to make a habit of [drawing every day](/3by5). I've mostly drawn with technical pens, but I recently slipped into the world of brush pens and dip pens, and I’m completely hooked on making new kinds of marks. Also, I have been learning how to paint. I’ve still very new at it, and I’m certainly doing it wrong. But painting, especially with watercolors, has been so much fun that I can't wait to start sharing some of the work here soon!
