Break Room Diaries is photo blog that features an office's break room from 2010 to 2013.  
There is a designated up-for-grabs table in the center of the break room where employees might leave holiday treats, extra catering, conference swag, sign up for girl scout cookies — I'm sure many break rooms or office common areas have a spot like this. I started taking posting photos of the weirder stuff found on the table.
The site was originally setup on tumblr, now Break Room Diaries has moved to Ghost CMS at https://breakroom.brxdlxy.com
