Break Room Diaries is a photo-blog about an office's break room from 2010 to 2013. There is a designated up-for-grabs table in the center of the break room where employees might leave treats, extra catering, and conference swag â€” I'm sure many break rooms or common areas have a spot like this.  It seemed like this break room more oddities than most so  I started posting photos.


The blog originally lived on Tumblr but now Break Room Diaries is running Ghost CMS as a stand-alone site at [breakroom.brxdlxy.com](https://breakroom.brxdlxy.com)
