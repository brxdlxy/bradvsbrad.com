I love 3x5 index cards. Recently, I started drawing on index cards as a creative warm-up before working in my sketchbook. Cards are great for sketching out new ideas. It helps me see how a color combo or composition might play out before committing to a whole page. Turns out, aimless doodling and coloring are pretty relaxing. Over the past couple of weeks, the cards have temporarily replaced my sketchbook. I would like to print some out as a quaranzine at some point. But for now, Iâ€™ll be posting scans of the cards in the gallery below.
