During the lock-down, I have been trying to learn to paint with watercolor. Now, I am adding a few pages to the site to share my progress. Painting has quickly become one of my favorite things, so I am pretty excited to show other people. Most of the images are watercolors, but I have also included some recent ink and mixed media drawings from my sketchbook. I hope you enjoy them!
