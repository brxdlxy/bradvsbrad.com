I recently started learning about water drop photography.  The basic idea is taking a high-speed photo of a waterdrop splashing into a dish or container of water. Typically, one would use a macro lens to magnify the little, tiny moment of impact.  I do not have a real macro lens, so I am using extension tubes on my 55-210mm for a similar effect. There are a couple of devices available to assist with synchronizing a camera with the water drops.  But I decided to try it the old fashioned way first.  I poked a hole in a ziplock bag full of water and clamped it up to cymbal stand.  For lighting, I used three speedlights (Yongnuo and Godox) and a bunch of gels. At first, the process was slow and tedious, but I eventually found a groove and a little success.  I am happy with the results so far and look forward to another session.
